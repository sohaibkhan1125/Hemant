            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">1. The Origins of Bitcoin</h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">Bitcoin was created by an anonymous individual or group of individuals known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was to create a decentralized digital currency that could operate without the need for a central authority like a bank or government.</p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Key Milestones in Bitcoin's History:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li className="leading-relaxed"><strong>2008:</strong> The Bitcoin whitepaper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" is published by Satoshi Nakamoto.</li>
                <li className="leading-relaxed"><strong>2009:</strong> The first Bitcoin block, known as the "genesis block," is mined, marking the launch of the Bitcoin network.</li>
                <li className="leading-relaxed"><strong>2010:</strong> The first real-world Bitcoin transaction occurs when 10,000 BTC is used to purchase two pizzas.</li>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. What is Bitcoin?</h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions over the internet. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by any central authority, such as a government or financial institution. Instead, it relies on a distributed ledger technology called blockchain to record and verify transactions.</p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Key Characteristics of Bitcoin:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li className="leading-relaxed"><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network of computers (nodes) that work together to maintain the blockchain.</li>
                <li className="leading-relaxed"><strong>Transparency:</strong> All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the blockchain, which is publicly accessible and transparent.</li>
                <li className="leading-relaxed"><strong>Security:</strong> Bitcoin uses advanced cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and prevent double-spending.</li>
                <li className="leading-relaxed"><strong>Limited Supply:</strong> There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, making it a deflationary asset.</li>
                <li className="leading-relaxed"><strong>Peer-to-Peer Transactions:</strong> Bitcoin allows users to send and receive payments directly without intermediaries.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">3. How Does Bitcoin Work?</h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network known as the blockchain. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions in a series of blocks. Each block contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block, creating a chain of blocks (hence the name blockchain).</p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Understanding the Blockchain:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li className="leading-relaxed"><strong>Mining:</strong> Bitcoin transactions are validated through a process called mining. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems, and the first one to solve it gets to add the next block to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly created Bitcoins.</li>
                <li className="leading-relaxed"><strong>Proof of Work:</strong> Bitcoin uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW), where miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles to add new blocks to the blockchain.</li>
                <li className="leading-relaxed"><strong>Wallets:</strong> Bitcoin wallets are digital tools that allow users to store, send, and receive Bitcoin. Wallets come in various forms, including hardware wallets, software wallets, and paper wallets.</li>
                <li className="leading-relaxed"><strong>Transactions:</strong> Bitcoin transactions involve transferring value from one address (public key) to another. The transaction is broadcast to the network, where it is verified by miners and added to the blockchain.</li>
            </ul>
